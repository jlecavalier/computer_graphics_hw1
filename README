1. Program description:
Explore the Lorenz attractor by changing
its parameters and viewing it from various
angles. In addition, watch the 3d path taken
by the lorenz attractor in animation mode.

2. Explorer Mode:
In explorer mode, view the lorenz attractor from
various angles. You can change all three 
parameters (s, b, and r) and also change how
frequently the colors cycle through the rainbow.

3. Animation Mode:
When you switch to animation mode, you can watch
the path of the lorenz attractor as it is traced
before your eyes. During the animation, you can
still change the viewing angle, the attractor
parameters, and the frequency of the color cycle.
When the animation finishes, this mode is equivalent
to explorer mode. Whenever you switch to animation
mode, the animation will start over from the
beginning.
